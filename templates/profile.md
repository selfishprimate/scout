# Candidate profile — {{FULL_NAME}}

This file is the only place personal values live. The Seekter skills read it at the start of every run and never hardcode any of it. When a preference changes, change it here, not in the skills.

Written by `/seekter-init`. Every value is concrete; the engine never fills a gap by guessing. Anything marked `ASK` is treated as unknown: the run asks the user instead of answering.

Last updated: {{DATE}}.

## 4. Salary bands

The **employer's region** decides the band, not where the candidate works from.

| Employer | Band |
|---|---|
| {{REGION_1}} | {{BAND_1}} |
| {{REGION_2}} | {{BAND_2}} |
| {{REGION_3}} | {{BAND_3}} |

- If the posting publishes a band, stay inside it.
- Annual fields: monthly × 12. Watch gross vs net.
- Number-only field without text: annual → top of band; monthly → middle.
- Free-text fallback: "Open to discussion, in line with the market range for this role."
- Clearly below band → stop and ask.
- Freelance rates: {{FREELANCE_RATES}}

---

## 5. Target roles

Apply to: {{TARGET_TITLES}}

Exclude:
- {{EXCLUDE_ROLES}}
- Any role requiring a language outside §1's list.

IC vs management line: {{MANAGEMENT_POLICY}}

Missing one core requirement is **not** a skip reason: apply and answer honestly. Four missing = noise.
